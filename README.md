# WebScraper1

This is a simple console application written in C# using the .NET framework allowing the user to scrape information from a website.

Note: Project Euler utilizes LaTeX for equation formatting, therefore in this simple program the LaTeX syntax will be apparent throughout the problem descriptions.
